## Minor

* The Monte Carlo simulation of parameters
  is done by the `MC()` function.
  The output of the `MC()` function
  is passed to the
  `BetaMC()`, `RSqMC()`, `SCorMC()`, `DeltaRSqMC()`, `PCorMC()`,
  and `DiffBetaMC()` functions
  to generate Monte Carlo confidence intervals
  for various regression effect sizes.
