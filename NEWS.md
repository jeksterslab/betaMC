# betaMC 1.3.0

## Minor

* Added the `MCMI()` function
  to perform  Monte Carlo simulation of parameters
  for data sets with missing values
  using multiple imputation.

# betaMC 1.2.0

## Minor

* The Monte Carlo simulation of parameters
  is done by the `MC()` function.
  The output of the `MC()` function
  is passed to the
  `BetaMC()`, `RSqMC()`, `SCorMC()`, `DeltaRSqMC()`, `PCorMC()`,
  and `DiffBetaMC()` functions
  to generate Monte Carlo confidence intervals
  for various regression effect sizes.

# betaMC 1.0.0

## Major

* And so it begins.
