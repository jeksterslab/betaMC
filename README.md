## Description

Generates Monte Carlo confidence intervals for standardized regression
coefficients (beta) and other effect sizes, including multiple
correlation, semipartial correlations, improvement in R-squared, squared
partial correlations, and differences in standardized regression
coefficients, for models fitted by `lm()`. `betaMC` combines ideas from
Monte Carlo confidence intervals for the indirect effect (Pesigan and
Cheung, 2024: <http://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-023-02114-4>) and the
sampling covariance matrix of regression coefficients (Dudgeon, 2017:
<http://doi.org/10.1007/s11336-017-9563-z>) to generate confidence
intervals effect sizes in regression.

## Installation

You can install the CRAN release of `betaMC` with:

``` r
install.packages("betaMC")
```

You can install the development version of `betaMC` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/jeksterslab/betaMC) with:

``` r
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jeksterslab/betaMC")
```

## Example

In this example, a multiple regression model is fitted using program
quality ratings (`QUALITY`) as the regressand/outcome variable and
number of published articles attributed to the program faculty members
(`NARTIC`), percent of faculty members holding research grants
(`PCTGRT`), and percentage of program graduates who received support
(`PCTSUPP`) as regressor/predictor variables using a data set from 1982
ratings of 46 doctoral programs in psychology in the USA (National
Research Council, 1982). Confidence intervals for the standardized
regression coefficients are generated using the `BetaMC()` function from
the `betaMC` package.

``` r
library(betaMC)
```

``` r
df <- betaMC::nas1982
```

### Regression

Fit the regression model using the `lm()` function.

``` r
object <- lm(QUALITY ~ NARTIC + PCTGRT + PCTSUPP, data = df)
```

### Monte Carlo Sampling Distribution of Parameters

#### Normal-Theory Approach

``` r
mvn <- MC(object, type = "mvn")
```

#### Asymptotic distribution-free Approach

``` r
adf <- MC(object, type = "adf")
```

#### Heteroskedasticity Consistent Approach (HC3)

``` r
hc3 <- MC(object, type = "hc3")
```

### Standardized Regression Slopes

#### Normal-Theory Approach

``` r
BetaMC(mvn, alpha = 0.05)
```

#### Asymptotic distribution-free Approach

``` r
BetaMC(adf, alpha = 0.05)
```

#### Heteroskedasticity Consistent Approach (HC3)

``` r
BetaMC(hc3, alpha = 0.05)
```

### Other Effect Sizes

The `betaMC` package also has functions to generate Monte Carlo
confidence intervals for other effect sizes such as `RSqMC()` for
multiple correlation coefficients (R-squared and adjusted R-squared),
`DeltaRSqMC()` for improvement in R-squared, `SCorMC()` for semipartial
correlation coefficients, `PCorMC()` for squared partial correlation
coefficients, and `DiffBetaMC()` for differences of standardized
regression coefficients.

#### Multiple Correlation Coefficients (R-squared and adjusted R-squared)

``` r
RSqMC(hc3, alpha = 0.05)
```

#### Improvement in R-squared

``` r
DeltaRSqMC(hc3, alpha = 0.05)
```

#### Semipartial Correlation Coefficients

``` r
SCorMC(hc3, alpha = 0.05)
```

#### Squared Partial Correlation Coefficients

``` r
PCorMC(hc3, alpha = 0.05)
```

#### Differences of Standardized Regression Coefficients

``` r
DiffBetaMC(hc3, alpha = 0.05)
```
