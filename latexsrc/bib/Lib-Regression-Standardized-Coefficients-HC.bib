		Yuan and Chan (Psychometrika 76:670–690, 2011. doi:10.1007/S11336-011-9224-6) derived consistent confidence intervals for standardized regression coefficients under fixed and random score assumptions.
		Jones and Waller (Psychometrika 80:365–378, 2015. doi:10.1007/S11336-013-9380-Y) extended these developments to circumstances where data are non-normal by examining confidence intervals based on Browne's (Br J Math Stat Psychol 37:62–83, 1984. doi:10.1111/j.2044-8317.1984.tb00789.x) asymptotic distribution-free (ADF) theory.
		Seven different heteroscedastic-consistent (HC) estimators were investigated in the current study as potentially better solutions for constructing confidence intervals on standardized regression coefficients under non-normality.
		Normal theory, ADF, and HC estimators were evaluated in a Monte Carlo simulation.
		Findings confirmed the superiority of the HC3 (MacKinnon and White, J Econ 35:305–325, 1985. doi:10.1016/0304-4076(85)90158-7) and HC5 (Cribari-Neto and Da Silva, Adv Stat Anal 95:129–146, 2011. doi:10.1007/s10182-010-0141-2) interval estimators over Jones and Waller's ADF estimator under all conditions investigated,
		as well as over the normal theory method.
		The HC5 estimator was more robust in a restricted set of conditions over the HC3 estimator.
		Some possible extensions of HC estimators to other effect size measures are considered for future developments.

		The multivariate delta method was used by Yuan and Chan to estimate standard errors and confidence intervals for standardized regression coefficients.
		Jones and Waller extended the earlier work to situations where data are nonnormal by utilizing Browne’s asymptotic distribution-free (ADF) theory.
		Furthermore, Dudgeon developed standard errors and confidence intervals, employing heteroskedasticity-consistent (HC) estimators, that are robust to nonnormality with better performance in smaller sample sizes compared to Jones and Waller’s ADF technique.
		Despite these advancements, empirical research has been slow to adopt these methodologies.
		This can be a result of the dearth of user-friendly software programs to put these techniques to use.
		We present the betaDelta and the betaSandwich packages in the R statistical software environment in this manuscript.
		Both the normal-theory approach and the ADF approach put forth by Yuan and Chan and Jones and Waller are implemented by the betaDelta package. 
		The HC approach proposed by Dudgeon is implemented by the betaSandwich package.
		The use of the packages is demonstrated with an empirical example.
		We think the packages will enable applied researchers to accurately assess the sampling variability of standardized regression coefficients.
